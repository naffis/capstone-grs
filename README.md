### Capstone GRS

Federal agencies are required to manage their email records in accordance with the [Federal Records Act](http://www.archives.gov/about/laws/fed-agencies.html) and [36 CFR Chapter XII Sub-chapter B](http://www.archives.gov/global-pages/exit.html?link=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a09457164851e8c5d055cbe8bcc26369&node=36:3.0.10.2.10&rgn=div5).  With the issuance of the [Managing Government Records Directive (M-12-18)](http://www.archives.gov/global-pages/exit.html?link=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2012/m-12-18.pdf), Goal 1.2, agencies are required to manage both permanent and temporary email records in an accessible electronic format by **December 31, 2016**. NARAâ€™s Capstone Approach and GRS 6.1 provide one way in which Federal agencies can meet these requirements.

The site contains data sets for active, approved NA-1005s submitted by Federal agencies. New data will continually be added to the repository on a rolling basis as forms are approved and/or superseded. Data from this form includes: 

* Name of the agency to which this form applies; 
* Applicable record group number; 
* Selection of which GRS 6.1 items the agency is proposing to use;
* Information on implementation scope and legacy email; and
* List of Capstone Officials.

The site also contains a small amount of additional information and links to other NARA resources on the responsibilities and status of email management across Federal agencies.
